# Getting Started With CashForward #

## Intro ##

In CashForward, Bills and Deposits are called _Payments_. Each Payment has one _Payee_ (who the Payment is coming from). Payments can also be tagged with _Labels_. Labels are useful for putting bills/deposits in certain groups or categories (e.g. Entertainment expenses, or income).

Payments can also be scheduled. Scheduled Payments are used to help project cashflow.

Once payments have been created, they can be associated with different _Scenarios_. For instance, you can compare your current Scenario (budget) with what it may look like with a new car payment, or additional income.
