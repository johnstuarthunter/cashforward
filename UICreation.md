# Rapid Development and Prototyping #

The NetBeans Platform exposes a dockable windowing system for applications. Each dockable window (or `TopComponent`) is customizable and easily constructed through the native form designer.

The window creation and placement is done through wizards; it is extremely quick to go from no UI to a basic application layout in a matter of clicks.

Together with the form designer, constructing a basic GUI skeleton takes literally a matter of minutes.

# Adding to the Palette #

Once the skeleton is complete, the work begins. Typically you'll find yourself using standard Swing components in the designer. But in the case where you need to use other 3rd party components, adding them to the palette is straightforward.

CashForward's own components were also used as palette items.
