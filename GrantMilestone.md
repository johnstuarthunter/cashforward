The release for the NetBeans Grant submission is [available for all platforms](http://cashforward.googlecode.com/files/CashForward_1.0.2.zip). It is exported directly from NetBeans - look in the cashforward/bin for the executables.

Documentation is available (soon) on the [Documentation site](Documentation.md)

Thanks!
