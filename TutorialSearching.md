## Filtering ##

The filters underneath the Scenario list (Bills and Deposits, and Labels) help to locate specific Payments. Choosing **Current**, for example, will show non-scheduled entries. Choosing **Scheduled** will show Payments that are scheduled. **Projected** shows the cashflow.

Selecting one or more Labels will narrow the Payment list to the selected Labels.

## Searching ##

Payments can also be searched using the Quick Search in the tool bar. Enter a payment amount, description, payee, date, or label; select 'Show Payments matching' and any matching payments will be shown.

To clear the Quick Search results, simply click back to the Current, Scheduled, or Projected payment filter.
