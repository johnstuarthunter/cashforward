One of my goals with the NetBeans Grant was to also catalog various the user interaction patterns in the application. However, due to time constraints, this section will not be as complete as it should.

A great list of user interface patterns has been put together by [Jenifer Tidell](http://designinginterfaces.com/).

Here are a few patterns found in CashForward:

  * [Two-Panel Selector](http://designinginterfaces.com/Two-Panel_Selector)
    * The PaymentDetail view
  * [Extras On Demand](http://designinginterfaces.com/Extras_On_Demand)
    * Again, the PaymentDetail view
  * [Movable Panels](http://designinginterfaces.com/Movable_Panels)
    * Dockable windows thanks to the NetBeans platform
  * [CardStack](http://designinginterfaces.com/Card_Stack)
    * In the Options panel
  * [Reponsive Enabling](http://designinginterfaces.com/Responsive_Enabling)
    * Because Actions attach to the UIContext (NetBeans Lookup)
  * [Drop Down Choose](http://designinginterfaces.com/Dropdown_Chooser)
    * Date selection, label selection, and Scenario graph control
