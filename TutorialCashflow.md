The Scenario CashFlow is a useful tool for viewing a budget (Scenario) projected out into the future. The graph show shows the balance in selected Scenarios over a specific time.

Clicking on the CashFlow will highlight the corresponding payment in the Payment table.

When more than one Scenario is selected, each Scenario will be displayed together in the CashFlow view.
